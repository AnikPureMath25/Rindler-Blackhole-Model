# Rindler-Blackhole-Model
Python code, Colab notebooks, and publication-ready vector figures for the Rindler Black Hole frame operator model. This work analyzes high-frequency suppression and pseudo-inversion of weighted frame operators adapted to black hole horizons using a Rindler spacetime toy model.
